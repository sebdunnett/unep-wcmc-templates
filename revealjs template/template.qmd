# General guidance

## How to use this slide deck

::::{.panel-tabset}

### Advice on Colour

:::{.smaller}
There are some slides in this template that use a different colour palette. We suggest that if your presentation is short, using colours other than blue is not necessary. If the presentation is long enough to be broken up into clear sections, however, we encourage that the sections are also defined by their own colours. Please do not intermix different coloured slides in a single section, it just makes it look messy and unclear. We ask that in all cases, your opening and closing slides are still in the default blue.
:::

### Advice on Text

:::{.smaller}
We strongly advise that text is as limited as possible across the board. It is, generally speaking, much more engaging to the viewer if the slide shows only key points / images / graphics, and the explanation is done entirely verbally. If the session is long and information heavy, or you just want the viewers to take as much in as possible, it may also be useful to send more detailed thoughts on the subject matter in document form before / after the presentation.
:::

::::

# Changing backgrounds

##

The background image of the title slide is set by the following YAML arguments:

```yaml
title-slide-attributes:
  data-background-image: "path_to_image.jpg"
  data-background-opacity: "0.25"
```

Otherwise background images are set by adding attributes to section headers, like `## Test {background-image="path_to_image.jpg" background-opacity=0.25}`.

The opacity may need to be adjusted depending on the brightness/contrast of the selected image.

# Images / graphics

##

You can replace the images in this template with the path of the image *relative* to the `.qmd` file.

Otherwise images *can* be imported directly from an Internet library like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

This is a full paragraph slide^[Note how boring this slide was to read. That is how your slide may be perceived by your audience should you use one too!] for the rare occasions you may wish to convey heavy amounts information on a slide. We advise against this and note that if you must use one of these slides in a presentation, to only do it once if possible. If more than one of these slides are required in one presentation, we strongly suggest breaking them up with images, other slides ETC.

It is possible to use graphics and indicators on one of these slides to break the monotony or convey key points. Such as the ones below that indicate our wordcount suggestions for one of these such slides.

## Coding

:::{.callout-tip}
You can include code using `#| echo: true` at the beginning of your code chunk.
:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|3|4,5,6"
#| echo: true
library(ggplot2)

  ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y~x")
```

## Font Awesome {{< fa font-awesome >}}

Included in this slide template is the ability to use icons from the `Font Awesome` library.

Icons can be written with shortcode, for example: `{{{< fa building-un >}}}` gives {{< fa building-un >}}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Sizing

Sizing can be achieved with the `size` argument (more [here](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome#user-content-fn-1-d08d1b637ed60d4b05ff62afbd304110)).

:::{style="bottom-border-style: solid"}
| Sizing Command             | LaTeX                 | HTML             | Icon                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| tiny                       | 5pt (= \\tiny)        | 0.5em            | {{< fa building-un size=tiny >}}       |
| normalsize                 | 10pt (= \\normalsize) | 1em              | {{< fa building-un size=normalsize >}} |
| large                      | 12pt (= \\large)      | 1.25em           | {{< fa building-un size=large >}}      |
:::

### Colouring

Colour can be added by using the following syntax:

* `[{{{< fa building-un >}}}]{style="color: #FDC742"}` [{{< fa building-un >}}]{style="color: #FDC742"}
* `[{{{< fa building-un >}}}]{style="color: #8B6FAF"}` [{{< fa building-un >}}]{style="color: #8B6FAF"}
* `[{{{< fa building-un >}}}]{style="color: #42B072"}` [{{< fa building-un >}}]{style="color: #42B072"}
